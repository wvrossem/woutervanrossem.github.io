summary: I helped organzize workshops for an event dedicated to programming for the youth of Brussels.
abstract: 'CoderDojo Belgium and the Software Languages Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel organized "CoderDojo (B)XL," an event at Muntpunt dedicated to learning to program for the youth of Brussels. Over 75 children learned to code in a playful manner that day. Through various activities such as unplugged programming, building websites, developing mobile apps, and controlling robots, the youngsters explored the fascinating world of computer science. As part of my involvment with Coder Dojo BXL, I helped organize the event by preparing some of the workshops for the day of the event. I also volunteered during the event.'
