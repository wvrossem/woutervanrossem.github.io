summary: "Launch of the Ontology Explorer: presentation by Analisa Pelizza and Wouter Van Rossem, discussant Aldo Gangemi"
abstract: "In the last decade, numerous sociotechnical developments have been under way to make visible who is travelling to Europe. While research on technologies of bordering tends to focus on the invisibility of people, less attention has been given to the invisibility of those data infrastructures that allow the informational management of mobility, migration and borders. Yet bringing such data infrastructures to the foreground is paramount, as they have a major role in how people on the move are not only represented, but enacted, with long-term consequences for their future life chances. 

The ontology explorer is a method and tool that moves a step towards addressing the invisibility of data infrastructures used at the border. Drawing on scholarship on data infrastructures and classifications in the social studies of technology (STS), the method and tool allows to semantically compare the ontologies implemented in diverse information systems used to identify people at borders.

This methodol and tool aims to answer a broad set of research questions about how people on the move are enacted through diverse data infrastructures, and how authorities and countries differ in the way they enact them.

Made with: Cytoscape.js a graph theory library for visualisation and analysis, Vue.js, open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications., Buefy for the UI components for Vue.js. The library itself is based on the Bulma framework and design."
