Photographer Ignacio Evangelista has made a beautiful series titled "After Schengen" where he photographed old border control checkpoints between EU Member States that are no longer in service since the Schengen agreement. See the full series [here](https://www.ignacioevangelista.com/arte/after-schengen/).

> These places that prior the Schengen treaty, delimited territories and in which the traveler had to stop and show his documents, currently appear as abandoned places, located in a space-time limbo, out of use and out of the time for which they were designed, as these states have opened their borders to the free movement of people. The observation of these places in the present time, gives them a dimension related to viewing and reading of some episodes in recent history, with the passing of time and memory in the landscape. These quasi- archaeological ruins have become part of the current landscape, forming a presence of the past that lies dormant in the present.
