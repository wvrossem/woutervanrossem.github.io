Today Mark Zuckerberg [accounced his new vision](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/) for Facebook as a more privacy-focused company. The principal change he thinks should be to have interoperable end-to-end encryption for all of Facebook's apps. Although this would be an interesting improvement to protect the communication, the links with law enforcement are worrying. Who is deciding what patterns identify "bad actors", and how are they not influenced by governments? It also a way for Facebook to seem like they deem it appropriate to decide who are "bad actors", which is equally worrying in my opinion.

> We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can. We are working to improve our ability to identify and stop bad actors across our apps by detecting patterns of activity or through other means, even when we can't see the content of the messages, and we will continue to invest in this work.

Another [piece from The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-privacy/) reminds us that may be another form of coporate white-washing, and how they haven't delivered on any other privacy improvement promises.
