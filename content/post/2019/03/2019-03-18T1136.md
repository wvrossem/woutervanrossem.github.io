I have been getting into the ideas of critical theory with some great podcasts and videos. Stephen West from Philosophize This did an extensive [7 part series on The Frankfurt School](http://philosophizethis.org), with a large focus on Herbert Marcuse. I especially liked his introductions of Marcuse's works and the parts on culture industry. I also watched [this interview Bryan Magee did with Marcuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KqC1lTAJx4) in 1977 for his BBC program. In the interview Marcuse gives an overview of the thoughts of the members of the school and his involvement with the New Left movement. The whole discussion with Magee is great as can be expected from him and who also very critical. And lastly I listened to [an episode of The Philosophers Zone](https://radio.abc.net.au/programitem/pezLjqzoxQ) titled "Are we enlightened?" that came out today by chance. In the short timespan of thirty minutes the podcast provides a fanstatic overview of critical theory and, as the title suggests, focuses on the theory's roots against enlightement style thinking.
