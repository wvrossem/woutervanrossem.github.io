Two important news updates via Tv5Monde's [7 jours sur la planète emission of 30 March 2019](https://www.tv5mondeplus.com/toutes-les-videos/magazine/7-jours-sur-la-planete-7-jours-sur-la-planete-30-03-19):

- "Nestlé accusé d'épuiser la nappe phréatique": in France some activist groups are campainging against Nestlé for the water the company is extracting from the ground for their bottled water. I can imagine this happening in a lot more places in the world as water becomes more scarce.
