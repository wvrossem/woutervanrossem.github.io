Today I learned that there are standards in the patterns of the bumpy parts on pavements ("*tactile paving*") that help visually impaired people move around. Apparently there are different patterns that have their own meaning, such as when there are steps ahead or near a platform. Check out [this video by Tom Scott](https://youtu.be/cdPymLgfXSY) that focuses on the patterns used in British streets. The standard they use ("Guidance on the use of Tactile Paving Surfaces") can be found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289245/tactile-paving-surfaces.pdf).
