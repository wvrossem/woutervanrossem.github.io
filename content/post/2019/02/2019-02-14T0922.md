Hettie O'Brien writes in [an article on The New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2019/02/why-technology-can-t-solve-irish-border-problem) on the fantasies of tech solutionism for Irish border:

> The logic here is peak Silicon Valley: technology vacates policies of their political intent, offering practical solutions that we can converge on regardless of political differences.

> Yet this politics-free vision of the Irish border amounts to magical thinking. It’s not because the necessary technologies don’t exist; many already do. It’s that the proposed solutions, whether visible or not, would effectively monitor everyone and everything that passed across the Irish border, making it one of the most closely observed and therefore political crossings in the world.
