I quite enjoyed [this series from Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five) where reported Kashmir Hill tries to not use any of the five big tech companies. It's especially revealing and perhaps lesser known how important they are on infrastructure of the internet. For example, Amazon hosts a large amount of websites, making it almost impossible to avoid Amazon completely.
