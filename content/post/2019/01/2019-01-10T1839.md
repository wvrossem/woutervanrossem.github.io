Great video essay on the channel 'The Pop Detective' on a trope that is used in the US television show The Big Bang Theory of [adorkable mysogyny](https://www.themarysue.com/adorkable-misogyny-big-bang-theory/): "*Adorkable misogynists are male characters whose geeky version of masculinity is framed as both comically pathetic and endearing. And it’s their status as nerdy nice guys that then lets them off the hook for a wide range of creepy, entitled, and downright sexist behaviors... These types of characters are shown engaging in a variety of harassing, entitled, and sexist behavior where women are concerned. They consistently stalk, spy on, lie to, and try to manipulate the women in their lives. They’re overbearing, they refuse to take ‘no’ for an answer, and they often ignore the basic tenets of consent.*".
