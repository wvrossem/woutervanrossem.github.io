The photography project ["*Wasteland*" by Kadir van Lohuizen](https://www.noorimages.com/lok-wasteland) contains some very powerful images of large cities and how they manage their waste. I think that the waste managment and recycling process has been going on too much in the background, and the only way out is to reduce our trash. See also [this article in the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8) on why the recycling system became more visible. In the word of Kadir: "*If the world is not prepared to think about waste reduction and actually treat waste as a resource, next generations will drown in their own waste.*"
