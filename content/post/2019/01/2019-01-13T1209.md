Just love this picture of Moai at Rano Raraku, Easter Island [by Horacio Fernandez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#/media/File:Moais,_Isla_de_Pascua._-_panoramio.jpg), how they are just scattered seemingly randomly and half disappearing into the ground. Reminds me also of the poem [Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias).

```poetry
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
```
