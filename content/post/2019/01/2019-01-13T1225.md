Just two things I noticed/read this week. Some of the most advanced humanoid robots and get a lot of attention are modelled as women (e.g. [Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)) or [Jia Jia](https://phys.org/news/2017-01-bionic-woman-chinese-robot-charm.html)). Tech shows such as CES where technology such as robots are showcased such as CES show [a history of being linked with the sex industry](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/12/684854958/high-tech-vibrator-ban-from-ces-show-stirs-claims-of-sexism) and [a lack of women in the industry](https://www.leafandcore.com/2018/01/15/ces-2018-excluded-women/).
