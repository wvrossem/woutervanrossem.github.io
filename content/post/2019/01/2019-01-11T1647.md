What a wonderful short excerpt from BBC documentary about Venice from 1969. I learned something new as well about the creation of "ghettos" in Venice: "*physically isolating a society of people [Jewish refugees] that it simultaneously despised and needed*". It also has some nice images of daily and more quiet life in Venice in winter that since then most likely has disappeared. Have [a look at the BBC Archive footage on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BBCArchive/status/1032627111738204160).
