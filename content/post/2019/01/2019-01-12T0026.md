Finished a second novel of Elizabeth Strout, ["*My Name is Lucy Barton*"](https://www.elizabethstrout.com/books/my-name-is-lucy-barton/). What a wonderful short novel full of heart and sincerity, I had to read it in one go! ðŸ“š Elizabeth Strout is an exceptional writer I must say; there are some many lovely phrases I was underlining throughout this book. The book is written in a concise way, but there are a lot layers in this story about Lucy Barton who is recovering after a surgery (and who is also writer in the novel), and has an opportunity to reconnect with her mother through gossip. Which allows Lucy to understand more about her own and her mother's difficult lives.
