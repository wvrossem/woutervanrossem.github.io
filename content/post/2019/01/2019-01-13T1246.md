Happy to learn more about Belgian philosopher of science [Isabelle Stengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_Stengers). Learn more about her [here in an introduction by Bruno Latour](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-70%20Stengers-foreword.pdf).

> Isabelle Stengers has chosen to look for  a  touchstone  distinguishing  good  science  from  bad  not  in  epistemology  but  in ontology, not in the word but in the world.

> If scientists are surprised by the ways she demarcates good from bad science, the many  people  who,  from  the  ranks  of  feminism,  ecology,  leftism,  think  she  is  their allies should brace themselves for some hard lessons, more exactly, from the lessons she keeps drawing from hard sciences. Going from science to politics is not, for her, going from stringent constraints to more relaxed ones, but keeping exactly the same objectives   with   a   total   indifference   to   what   is   science   and   what   is   society. Domination  in  politics  has  many  of  the  same  ingredients  it  has  in  the  laboratory, that  is,  the  unability  to  let  the  people  one  deals  with  any  chance  to  redefine  the situation  in  their  own  terms.  If  this  principle  subverts  so  many  disciplines  from  the inside,  it  subverts  even  more  political  stands  from  the  outside,  and  especially  so many  of  the  “standpoint  politics”  where  the  outcome  of  the  analysis  is  entirely determined  from  the  start  by  the  position  of the  speaker.
