Sad to learn that the American poet [Mary Oliver has passed away](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/obituaries/mary-oliver-dead.html). I always enjoy her keen obervational poems that show her high attentiveness to the natural world. Read some of her poetry [on the Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-oliver).

```poetry
When it's over, I don't want to wonder
if I have made of my life something particular, and real.

I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,
or full of argument.

I don't want to end up simply having visited this world
```

*From "When Death Comes" - Mary Oliver*
