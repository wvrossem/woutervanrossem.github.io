It seems that some ["*literary elites*"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/keep-your-tidy-spark-joy-hands-off-my-book-piles-marie-kondo/2019/01/10/28dd7a8c-14ee-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html) feel threatened by the approach of Marie Kondo [to only keep books that "*spark joy*"](http://www.openculture.com/2019/01/marie-kondo-v-tsundoku-two-japanese-philosophies-on-whether-to-keep-or-discard-unread-books.html). I agree that books don't have to necessarily give you joy, and from my perspective you should only keep the ones that had an impact on you and you reach for regularly. But if you care so much about hoarding your books, is there not some part of you that simply needs them to keep up your profile as an intellectual? I have a few books myself that I want to keep, but most of the books that I have read and shaped me are also on the shelves of public libraries, or I have given away again.
