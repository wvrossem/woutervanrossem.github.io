ðŸ“– First time reading a book by Elizabeth Strout, finished ["*Olive Kitteridge*"](https://www.elizabethstrout.com/books/olive-kitteridge/). Very well written prose and amazing how she can give us such a detailed glimpse into all those different characters' lives using only small stories. I didn't get any special attachment to Olive Kitteridge herself though, and sometimes her character seems a bit forced in the story to make a link between the different segments. But overall I enjoyed it and found several stories quite memorable.
