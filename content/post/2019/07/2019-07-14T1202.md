Exploring some videos on by forest ecologists on how trees communicate [via Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/2019/07/the-secret-language-of-trees.html). The following is a short educational [Ted-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4m9SefyRjg) in which Camille Defrenne and Suzanne Simard explain how trees communicate through their complex root system and the symbiotic relationship with fungi.

For a longer video on the same topic there is also TED talk by Suzanne Simard on ["How trees talk to each other"](https://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_simard_how_trees_talk_to_each_other/discussion?language=en).
