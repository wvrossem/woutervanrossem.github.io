Watching a video with excerpts from the Chomsly-Foucault debate [via Aeon.co](https://aeon.co/videos/when-chomsky-met-foucault-how-the-thinkers-debated-the-ideal-society). These shorts segments give a good quick look on the diverging view of Chomsky and Foucault and their views on power and human nature.

> With the Vietnam War near its height, Chomsky and Foucault agree that contemporary power structures need to be attacked and dismantled. However, while Chomsky advocates for a system of ‘anarcho-syndicalism’ rooted in justice, sympathy and human creativity, Foucault argues that these concepts are products of the same bourgeois system that needs replacing. Probing age-old philosophical questions as well as the politics of the moment, the interview offers a revealing glimpse of the divergent styles, attitudes and outlooks of two enduringly influential thinkers.
