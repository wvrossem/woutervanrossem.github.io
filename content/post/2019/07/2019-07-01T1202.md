It took me a while to find the time, but finally started listening to the new Big Thief album, "U.F.O.F.". The lyrics are as curious as always with short mysterious vignettes filled with names, colours and animals. Overall the albums sounds magical, with some wonderful moments like the screams from the guitar in the song "Contact". Favorite track of the albums currently is "Orange".
