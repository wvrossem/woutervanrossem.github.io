Having fun looking at two posts from Sociological Images on gendered products:

- [A post about a video](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2019/03/26/i-win/) that compiles clips of white boys winning in old commercials of board games for children in the US.
- And a post with images of ["pointlessly gendered products"](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/10/26/pink-earplugs-for-your-beauty-sleep/).
