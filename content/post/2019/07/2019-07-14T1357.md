A TED talk from  Emma Marris, a writer who focuses on environmentalism, where she proposes us to redefine what is considered nature. I particularly enjoyed the section where she urges to rethink how we look at wild nature ("novel ecosystems") in for example abandoned places cities. Watch the whole talk [on the TED website](https://www.ted.com/talks/emma_marris_nature_is_everywhere_we_just_need_to_learn_to_see_it).

> How do you define "nature?" If we define it as that which is untouched by humans, then we won't have any left, says environmental writer Emma Marris. She urges us to consider a new definition of nature -- one that includes not only pristine wilderness but also the untended patches of plants growing in urban spaces -- and encourages us to bring our children out to touch and tinker with it, so that one day they might love and protect it.
