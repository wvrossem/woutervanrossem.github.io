Great day today with the Processing Citizenship team and [Professor Kalpana Shankar](http://kalpanashankar.com/index.html) where we discussed connections with her work on social science data archives and data curation practices. Afterwards she also gave a colloquium at our UTwente STePS department on "_Data Work as Organizational Work: The Sustainability of Social Science Data Archives_".
