Looking at a [keynote presentation of Lisa Nakamura at the transmediale 2018](https://transmediale.de/content/lisa-nakamura-delivering-her-keynote-call-out-protest-speak-back-0) "Call Out, Protest, Speak Back". She focuses on the importance of critical race and feminist theory for understanding contemporary culture of digital technologies. Interesting use of Audrey Lorde's quote that "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" and how we can't fix technology with more technology.
