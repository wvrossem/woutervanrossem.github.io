Listening to a podcast from the BBC program In Our Time about [Henri Bergon's ideas on time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0004s9w). Some ideas I found noteworthy:

- The historical background of thinking about time during the 19th century. The appearance of timelines, focus on time, influence of trains, timezones.
- The measurements of time and links with looking at it as space. And that then the lived experience falls out of the equation.
- Coexistence of past and presence.
