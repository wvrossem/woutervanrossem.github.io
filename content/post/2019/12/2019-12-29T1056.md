A new article by Input Magazine gives a good example of green washing and why we need the right to repair our own devices. The article is about a "recycling mode" for Sonos devices that effectively bricks a device, and makes it impossible for it to enter the second-hand market. Read the short article [here](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/sonos-recycling-mode-is-bricking-perfectly-good-devices).

> Sonos implements a setting called "recycling mode" that bricks consumer's devices after 21 days, essentially keeping them from being reused or resold on the secondary market. (...) Sonos' "Trade Up" program is meant to offer its customers an incentive to upgrade, which, naturally, benefits Sonos the most â€” by reeling customers with older devices back into a new product lifecycle.
