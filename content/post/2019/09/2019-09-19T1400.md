Last Sunday I saw a great documentary in the "Tegenlicht" series from the Dutch VPRO television station. The title of this episode is "Mijn Bullshitbaan" and it gives an overview of the work of the anthropologist David Graeber on "bullshit jobs" through interview segments with him and examples from the experience of different people in the Netherlands. I could relate to quite a few things from my own professional career. Have a look at the full episode [here](https://www.vpro.nl/programmas/tegenlicht/kijk/afleveringen/2018-2019/Mijn-bullshitbaan.html).
