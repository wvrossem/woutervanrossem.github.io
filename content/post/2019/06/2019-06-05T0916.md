Reading an article on "Flexible Turtles and Elastic Octopi: Exploring Agile Practice in Knowledge Work"[^1], where the authors introduce the concept of elastic workers:

> We label this form of flexibility as ‘elastic’ to account for the fact that these practices appear to be less a response to dynamic external conditions than a co-construction of external conditions with the internal disposition of the worker. To be elastic, in these terms, is to learn to find stability in dynamic circumstances beyond any one situation, perpetually.
