The documentary “The secrets of civilization” gave fascinating insights into how Romans changed their environment. First, there is an artificial mound in Rome known as [Monte Testaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Testaccio), a big ancient waste heap which is nearly entirely made of broken pieces from discarded containers (amphora) used for, for example, storing olive oil. Here are two videos about the site:

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L4GLMY6unc) is from the ArchaeoSpain archaeology project who were working at this site.
* An [excerpt from a BBC documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3g5CkSSBY ) with scholar Mary Beard.

Second, the documentary mentioned how a landscape in Spain, Las Médulas is the result of a Roman gold-mining technique called [Ruina Montium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruina_montium) ("wrecking of mountains"). Here is [a video describing the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrAgh51FNA0) from IMAGEEN.

Finally, it's interesting to know that it seems that a period of unusually warm weather, called the [Roman Climactic Optimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period), may have benefitted the Romans.
