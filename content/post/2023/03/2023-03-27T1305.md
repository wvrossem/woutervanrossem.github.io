[This article from the Financial Times](https://archive.is/https://www.ft.com/content/6ac009d5-dbfd-4a86-839e-28bb44b2b64c) provides some funny criticisms on the "invention" of Italian food traditions based on the work of Alberto Grandi. The article also points out a link with food and nationalistic politics:

> Today, Italian food is as much a leitmotif for rightwing politicians as beautiful young women and football were in the Berlusconi era. As part of her election campaign in 2022, prime minister Giorgia Meloni posted a TikTok video in which an old lady taught her how to seal tortellini parcels by hand. This month, Meloni’s minister of agriculture, Francesco Lollobrigida, suggested establishing a task force to monitor quality standards in Italian restaurants around the world. He fears that chefs may get recipes wrong, or use ingredients that aren’t Italian. (Officially listed “traditional food products” now number a staggering 4,820.)
