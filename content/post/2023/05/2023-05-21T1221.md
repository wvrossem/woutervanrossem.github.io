Cornelia Mayr explains in [a blog post at Everyday Sociology](https://web.archive.org/web/20230519000513/https://www.everydaysociologyblog.com/2023/05/keeping-order-at-home.html) how the concept of home is created through "home-making practices," such as organizing a space. She uses the insights from anthropologist Mary Douglas, who explained how keeping things in their proper place contributes to a sense of domestic order:

> For the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1991, p. 289), the home is a “localizable idea” that “starts by bringing some space under control.” In this sense, a place like home acquires its meaning through home-making practices; and as such, it becomes part of processes of the creation of domestic order. Put differently, order is sustained and things go smoothly so long as they are being kept in the proper place within the home.
