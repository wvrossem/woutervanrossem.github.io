In [an opinion piece at The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/739235bc-c418-4895-a426-3bd245ec6a00), Izabella Kaminska compares the creation of Meta/Facebook's metaverse to the creation of Las Vegas during The Great Depression of the 1930:

> In the long run, if there is any moral to the Las Vegas story it’s that if you want to bootstrap a fantasy realm for the purpose of enriching a small elite at the expense of users, it helps to have a repressed, desperate and captured demographic within your proximity. With the metaverse it’s unlikely to be any different. You’re still going to be the product. You may be more accepting of it, but only because base reality is getting more and more like historic Boulder City by the day.
