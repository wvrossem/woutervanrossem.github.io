[An article](https://web.archive.org/web/20211028172022/https://slate.com/culture/2012/10/a-very-unusual-camera-that-emphasizes-time-over-space.html) from Slate.com describes photography technique used by photographer Jay Mark Johnson to "emphasize time over space":

> [H]e uses a slit camera that emphasizes time over space. Whatever remains still is smeared into stripes, while the motion of crashing waves, cars and a Tai Chi masterâ€™s hands are registered moment by moment, as they pass his camera by.  Like an EKG showing successive heartbeats, the width of an object corresponds not to distance or size, but the rate of movement. Viewing the left side of the picture is not looking leftward in space but backward in time.
