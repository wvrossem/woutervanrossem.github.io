Two interesting articles from MIT Technology Review:

* [This article](http://web.archive.org/web/20211123145400/https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/) examines what might happen with the biometric databases that were established in Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover of the country.
* [Another article](http://web.archive.org/web/20210928022148/http://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/03/1030460/women-erased-tech-history-computing/) discusses "TikTok's decision to use a womanâ€™s voice without her permission" as very literal example of how women's voices are written out of the history of computing.
