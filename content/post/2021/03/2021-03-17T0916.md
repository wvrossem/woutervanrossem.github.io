Apparently rare user names on big social media platform have become so valuable that there is even a marketplace for such names that have been obtained by hackers. As [an article at The Verge](http://web.archive.org/web/20210317082208/https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266741/instagram-ogusers-rare-usernames-crackdown-disable-accounts-tiktok-twitter) details:  

> These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have rules barring the buying and selling of accounts, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them.
