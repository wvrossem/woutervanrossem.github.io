The column on language by Johnson's at the Economist [](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/06/05/google-will-nudge-users-to-adopt-gender-neutral-language) reports that Google announced that its word processor Google Docs will start to nudge users to use more inclusive language:

> On May 18th the company announced that it was going further in its promotion of inclusive language. Google Docs, its popular free word­processing software, would soon be nudging people away from potentially sexist language, such as the generic use of “chairman”. Instead it will offer gender­ neutral suggestions including “chairperson”.
