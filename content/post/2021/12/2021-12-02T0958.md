Two interesting quotes from Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde  concerning file-sharing in [an article at TorrentFreak](https://web.archive.org/web/20211130184541/https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-cant-be-stopped-co-founder-says-211128/). First, he mentions how file-sharing "paved the way for legal streaming services":

> “File-sharing has definitely helped the rise of services like Spotify and Netflix,” Sunde told M3, noting that this wasn’t what the Pirate Bay team envisioned. Instead, they wanted to move the power back from large companies to individual artists.”

Second, the importance of file-sharing for people around the world:

> “I constantly meet people all over the world who tell me how important it has been (and is) for them to have access to materials. People who otherwise could not have the profession they have or who have learned the language and culture,” Sunde said.
