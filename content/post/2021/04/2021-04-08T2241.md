A [blog post at Boardgamegeek](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408201031/https://www.boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/116270/links-changing-times-game-industry) collects some recent links discussion changes in boardgames. Some of the points mentioned concern how the industry has changed because of crowd-funded games through the Kickstarter platform and reference an interesting [article from Wired](https://web.archive.org/web/20210310140319/https://www.wired.com/story/dungeons-dragons-diversity/) that discussed how the company behind the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons is dealing with racial stereotypes in the game. From the article:

> In its post, WotC detailed the changes it planned to make to Dungeons & Dragons. This included overhauling the way its books talked about orcs, drow, and other “evil” races, updating past books like Curse of Strahd with an eye to removing racially charged language and stereotypes, releasing new rules that deemphasize racial negatives during character construction, hiring sensitivity readers, and hiring a more diverse pool of freelance writers and artists.
