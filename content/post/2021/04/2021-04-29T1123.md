[The Register reports on a paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429092928/https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/29/tech_ai_funding/) that aims to show how Big Tech has adopted similar strategies similar to Big Tobacco to influence AI ethics research, policy, and generally spreading doubts about the harms of AI:

> The analogy "is not perfect," the two brothers acknowledge, but is intended to provide a historical touchstone and "to leverage the negative gut reaction to Big Tobaccoâ€™s funding of academia to enable a more critical examination of Big Tech." The comparison is also not an assertion that Big Tech is deliberately buying off researchers; rather, the researchers argue that "industry funding warps academia regardless of intentionality due to perverse incentive.
