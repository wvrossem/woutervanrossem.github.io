In an [article at The Atlantic](https://web.archive.org/web/20210417174549if_/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/03/amazon-twitter-aggression/618477/) Ian Bogost comments on a recent episode of Amazon's use of social media in a campaign to influence opinion regarding criticisms of the company's exploitative labour and business practices. Interestingly, he notes a change in the corporations communicate:

> Previously, companies could speak only through formal messages on billboards; by mail, radio, or television; or via media coverage of their actions. The web had shifted that control a bit, but websites were still mostly marketing and service portals. Social media and smartphones changed everything. They made corporate speech functionally identical to human speech. Case law might have given companies legal personhood, but the internet made corporations feel like people.

> It also allowed companies to behave like people. As their social-media posts were woven into people’s feeds between actual humans’ jokes, gripes, and celebrations, brands started talking with customers directly. They offered support right inside people’s favorite apps. They did favors, issued giveaways, and even raised money for the downtrodden. Brands became #brands.
