Two recent articles from BBC Future deal with meta-data and possibilities of surveillance in two everyday technologies:

* [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210407212947/https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210324-the-hidden-fingerprint-inside-your-photos) explains how photographs can have a unique fingerprint because of the camera's sensor: "different sensitivities of the photosites creates a type of imperceptible image watermark. Although unintentional, it acts like a fingerprint, unique to your camera’s sensor, which is imprinted onto every photo you take."
* And [another article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210405041559/https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170607-why-printers-add-secret-tracking-dots) explains how colour printers add dots — that are invisible to the naked eye —, representing meta-data about the printer to documents.
