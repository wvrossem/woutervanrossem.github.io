This [article from The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/07/24/neuroscientific-research-on-monkeys-is-ethically-troubling-but-vital) is worth a read to understand their position on brain research and the use of primates in studies: 

> And were laboratories in China and Japan to come up with treatments for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s as a result of their studies of monkeys’ brains, it would be near impossible for Western countries to refuse to buy them to treat their citizens. Leaving others to do the dirty work of generating knowledge using means you consider to be unethical, while at the same time encouraging it by adding to demand is not taking the moral high ground. It is hypocrisy. Better for Western countries to carry out the necessary but troubling research them- selves, working to the standards they deem necessary.
