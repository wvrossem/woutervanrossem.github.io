While living in northern Italy, I was impressed by the value, quality, and dependability of the rail service. For example, my ride on the high-speed Italo train from Bologna to Rome was one of the best train journeys I’ve ever had. [An article in Railway Technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20241120042759/https://www.railway-technology.com/features/how-spain-became-the-arena-for-high-speed-rail-competition/) highlights the surprising success of private railway companies and the introduction of high-speed rail services like Italo.

> Despite Italo shifting Trenitalia’s 100% market cap [...] Trenitalia actually saw an increase in revenue during that period. High-speed rail was, and is, competing with low-cost flights, and despite the shift in market cap between the two train operators, they were actually winning more passengers from air to rail overall than from one another. [...] The growth of both Italo and Trenitalia is also thanks to the fact that Italo’s growth was due to induced demand: if you build it, they will come. Or, you could say that the market for low-cost high-speed rail didn’t exist until Italo created it.
