[An article in the Korea Herald](http://web.archive.org/web/20241128075823/https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20241127050041&ACE_SEARCH=1) I read today discussed the use of funeral wreaths as a protest metho in South Korea. These wreaths, traditionally used for funerals, are now being sent with messages to convey dissatisfaction.

[One recent example](http://web.archive.org/web/20241128081008/https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20241126050078&ACE_SEARCH=1) of this is K-Pop fans who protested against a dispute between artists and their management company.

> In reaction, some fans sent funeral wreaths to the agencyâ€™s headquarters in Seoul with messages such as "Hong Seunghan Out," "Remove Hong Seunghan," and "Riize is Forever Six" to protest his return.
