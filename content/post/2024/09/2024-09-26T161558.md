While reading The Korean Herald at my local library, I came across [a column by Robert J. Fouser](http://web.archive.org/web/20240926072011/https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240922050198&ACE_SEARCH=1) about the “soundscape of Korean cities”. It’s possible that he’s correct about cities like Seoul being quieter due to reduced noise from cars, public transportation, and people. However, I can certainly confirm that there are other noise disturbances, such as the music coming from street shops and the sounds of people’s digital devices (notifications, audio from videos). Here's an excerpt from the article:

> The sounds of the digital revolution are everywhere, most noticeable in the beeps of notifications. Sometimes a beep nearby causes people to check their phones. And the ubiquitous KakaoTalk sounds are now embedded in the soundscape of Korean cities. By law, cameras on Korean mobile phones are required to produce a shutter click, which creates a burst of clicks when many people take pictures of the same thing.

It seems to me that the acceptance of noises greatly varies depending on the place. My local library is one of those places that is incredibly quiet and serene. There’s even a sign reminding people to be mindful of their noise levels when using the keyboard and mouse.
