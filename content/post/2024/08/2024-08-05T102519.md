Tim Harford released another outstanding episode in his “Cautionary Tale” podcast series. [The episode](http://web.archive.org/web/20240805013115/https://timharford.com/2024/07/8801/) is called “Flying Too High: AI and AirFrance Flight 447” and tells a a frightening tale of a fatal plane crash caused by pilot errors when the fly-by-wire system temporarily malfunctioned.

The episode presents interesting concepts, one of which is the de-skilling of pilots, causing them to make incorrect assessments and take wrong actions because of lack of experience of flying without the systems. The _automation paradox_ is that as automation becomes more sophisticated and reduces the need for human intervention, human skills become even more critical for handling exceptional and often dangerous situations.
