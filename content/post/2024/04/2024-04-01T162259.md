The MIT Press Reader shared [an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20240401073132/https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-nuclear-fallout-maps-that-revealed-a-contaminated-planet/) excerpted from the book “Cultures of Contagion”. The article highlights how the study of radioactive particle movements worldwide during the 1950s and beyond has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of global interconnectedness of our biosphere.

> This new geophysical knowledge forms the foundation of our current global atmospheric and oceanic circulation models. Importantly, in tracking the diffusion of radionuclides both through the atmosphere and through plants, animals, and human populations, scientists could demonstrate the integration and interconnectedness of the entire biosphere.
