A mountain town in the Italian Alps, surrounded by steep mountains that obscure sunlight, erected a large mirror in 2006 to track the sun’s trajectory and bounce sunlight into the town square. The mayor, in an interview quoted in [this Vice article](https://web.archive.org/web/20241214173423/https://www.vice.com/en/article/viganella-italy-fake-manmade-sun/), explained the project’s humanistic aims superseded its scientific foundation:

> Although created to solve a very practical problem, the project has an almost poetic side to it too. “The idea behind the project doesn’t have a scientific basis, but a human one,” former mayor Midali said in a 2008 interview. “It comes from a desire to let people socialise in winter when the town shuts down due to the cold and the dark.”
