The presence of pet dogs and strollers for small dogs is highly noticeable in South Korea, including where I live. A recent [article from Korea JoongAng Daily](https://web.archive.org/web/20241009034514/https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-10-05/why/WHY-Animals-on-wheels-Why-are-pet-strollers-so-popular-in-Korea/2148297) suggests that the increase in dog strollers might also be due to changes in policies at shops and venues, which now require dogs to be in strollers for entry.

> In Korea, more venues require pets to be kept in carriers or strollers when indoors. This trend has led to a rise in dog strollers as a necessity for pet owners who wish to bring their furry companions along when they go out. [...]
> The Hyundai Seoul department store in Yeouido also offers dog stroller rentals. The store allows pets in strollers or carriers in most areas, except for food sections. Hyundai Department Store has adopted similar policies across its branches, catering to pet owners by permitting indoor access for pets in designated strollers or bags.
