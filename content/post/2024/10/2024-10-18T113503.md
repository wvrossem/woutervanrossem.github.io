In their decision to abandon reunification, North Korea is eliminating all symbols that represented a unified Korean peninsula. I found that some of these logos, including Air Koryo’s, were actually quite beautiful. Their national air carrier logo featured a flying crane with wings shaped like the Korean Peninsula. To learn more, check out [the following article from NK News](http://web.archive.org/web/20240512184046/https://www.nknews.org/2024/04/north-koreas-air-koryo-changes-logo-to-comply-with-new-anti-unification-policy/).

> North Korea’s national carrier Air Koryo has changed its logo to comply with a new state policy opposing unification with South Korea, according to NK News analysis.
> The former logo featured a flying crane with an outstretched wing in the loose shape of the Korean Peninsula.
> But the peninsula shape has now been replaced with a more tapered wing with stylized horizontal stripes.
