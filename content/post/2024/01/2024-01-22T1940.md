Yesterday, I had the pleasure of visiting the city of Ravenna and admiring its exquisite mosaics. The rich history of this city is eloquently encapsulated in a quote from the host of the Medievalists Podcast during [an episode featuring a conversation with Judith Herrin](http://web.archive.org/web/20240122184827/https://www.medievalists.net/2021/01/ravenna-judith-herrin/) on Ravenna's history between 400 and 800 AD.

> "[h]istory tends to get pulled through Ravenna rather than Ravenna pulling itself through history. [Ravenna] tends to fall into various cracks in the way we organize history." (+- at 4')

Indeed, the city of Ravenna bears witness to the passage of various powers, each leaving behind remarkable buildings and works of art.
