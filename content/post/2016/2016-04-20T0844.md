Writing good commit messages, [7 important rules](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) I'm using now as well:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
