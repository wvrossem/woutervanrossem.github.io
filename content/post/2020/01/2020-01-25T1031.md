Two interesting articles from the Economist 1843 magazine:

- In [this article](https://www.1843magazine.com/upfront/postcard-from-silicon-valley/at-san-franciscos-salesforce-park-a-city-drifts-into-the-clouds) from the "Postscards from Silicon Valley" series the author discusses the "San Franciscoâ€™s Salesforce Park", the parc's links with the tech industry and how the design/architecture of the park excludes some people.
- And [another article](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/hippie-inc-how-the-counterculture-went-corporate) about San Franscisco and Silicon Valley explores "_the gradual absorption of the counterculture by capital_".
