Facebook made available a new tool this week which allows users to see which businesses have shared information from these users with Facebook. Although lucklily only one, I was suprised to see that one company shared a purchase with Facebook without me being aware. The Verge [reported on the release](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111981/facebooks-clear-history-tool-now-available-to-everyone).

As usual the tool is hidden somewhere in the settings: Settings —> Your Facebook Information —> Off-Facebook Activity.
