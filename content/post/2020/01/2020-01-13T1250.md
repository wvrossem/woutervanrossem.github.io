DW Documentary posted a new documentary about the ongoing proliferation of tourists and rising property prices in Lisbon, Portugal. The documentary follows someone from the local council and shows the efforts undertaken by the city to save its old, long established shops and their shop owners who are at risk of being pushed out of the city.

I already heard of this problem, but this video also sheds extra light on the issue of [golden visas in Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_Golden_Visa). And the problems this program is connected to.
