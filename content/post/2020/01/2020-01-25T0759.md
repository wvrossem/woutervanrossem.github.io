Via Wikipedia I learned that on the 24th of January 1848 James W. Marshall discovered gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California, leading to the California Gold Rush. I decided to learn more about those years through the documentary ["The West Episode 03: The Speck Of The Future 1848 - 1856"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1o3C3uYJWQ). Absolutely insane how this event spawned a migration of some many people from all over the world to California, with far-reaching effects on the wealth of this state and devastating effects on nature and original inhabitants.
