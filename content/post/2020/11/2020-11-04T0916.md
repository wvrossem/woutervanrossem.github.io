Member of the European Parliament Sofie in 't Veld wrote [an article on about:intel](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104073007/https://aboutintel.eu/palantir-eu-independence/) about the reliance on foreign and US technologies in EU domestic security, such as Palantir. Here's a quote from her conclusions:

> The European Union is overly reliant on foreign companies for digital services, both on the government and the consumer level. This reliance cannot be fixed overnight. It is however high time to make choices that at least steer the EU towards more strategic independence. Companies that don’t fall within the EU’s jurisdiction cannot be involved with matters of domestic security. This must be particularly true for companies that have strong ties to American security services, as is the case with Palantir.
