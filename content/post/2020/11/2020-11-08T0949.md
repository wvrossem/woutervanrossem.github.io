Eva Modebadze wrote an interesting article in relation to the current protests for abortion rights in Poland. The following is a quote from [her article on foucaultblog](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107054629/https://www.fsw.uzh.ch/foucaultblog/essays/265/re-patriarchisation-female-bodies), in which she recaps the argument on the interlinkages between the construction of gender, sexuality and the nation state:

> Gender, sexuality and nationalism are all socially and culturally constructed in oppositions, sometimes not necessarily binary. The nation consists of sexed subjects who are part of culturally constructed hierarchies, and these relationships always involve power. By the control over sexuality and reproduction, the authority to define what is right and what is bad for the nation lies mainly within patriarchal notions of nationalism. Since nationalism is about difference, it is equally exclusive where hierarchies are constructed along the lines of gender, class, race or sexuality. The rise of nationalism enhances the politics of exclusion and takes different configurations in different settings.
