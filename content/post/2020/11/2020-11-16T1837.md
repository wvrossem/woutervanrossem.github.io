Politico [reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20201117165349/https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-to-curtail-spyware-exports-to-authoritarian-countries/) on some new EU regulations which would restrict the exports of surveillance technologies by companies.

> The update to EU rules, expected to be agreed within weeks, would set up a comprehensive EU list of technologies that governments can control through licensing. It would also increase due diligence obligations on companies to check if their goods can be used by their clients to violate human rights.
