The Register reported on the announcement of Apple to introduce "privacy 'nutrition labels'" (https://web.archive.org/web/20201109184222/https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/06/apple_privacy_advice/):

> "For food, you have nutrition labels; you can see if it's packed with protein or loaded with sugar, or maybe both, all before you buy it," he said. "So we thought it would be great to have something similar for apps. We're going to require each developer to self-report their practices."

From [the announcement by Apple](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109163307/https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vlj9jty9):

> Later this year, the App Store will help users understand an app’s privacy practices before they download the app on any Apple platform. On each app’s product page, users can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them.
