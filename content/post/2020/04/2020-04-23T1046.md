[Allowed to grow old](https://web.archive.org/web/20200423085325/https://www.isaleshko.com/allowed-to-grow-old-project-info) is a project by photographer Isa Leshko. In this project she made photographic portraits of farm animals. These animals usually never have the chance to grow old and I found them very moving.
