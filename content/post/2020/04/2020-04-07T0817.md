One aspect of this coronavirus pandemic is the spread of information. I therefore find this reflection by Erin McAweeney on ["Who Benefits from Health Misinformation?"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200407061704/https://points.datasociety.net/who-benefits-from-health-misinformation-8d094804058d?gi=26ef387f7f7e) quite important:

> Different groups with different motives are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic in different ways. I’m a senior analyst at Graphika, a social media network analysis firm, where we map “cyber-social terrain” and the information that flows through them. To date, we’ve found online communities from health topics, political groups, and social identity groups pushing misinformation on COVID-19: grifter televangelists, QAnon, MAGA Twitter, anti-vaxxers, conservative and anti-CCP politicians and billionaires, and anti-immigration parties in France and Italy. These groups frame and misrepresent the issue to fit their ideological goals.
