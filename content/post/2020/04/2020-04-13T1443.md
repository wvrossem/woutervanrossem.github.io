This is an interesting piece of news the The New York Times: ["Burning Cell Towers, Out of Baseless Fear They Spread the Virus"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200413124403/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html). On the one hand, there indeed seemd to be a problem with disinformation about 5G as origin of the novel corona virus.

But then again, it seems remarkable again that the events described in the article are being pushed aside as groundless fear of luddites. While it seems to me that this is yet another example of technology that is pushed through without much input and that not many people are waiting for.

Instead of scoffing away these people it could taken seriously as real (physical) issue with disputes. And seems to me a good example where publics in the sense John Dewey can arise, as this technology has different meanings for different people.
