Al Jazeera made a nice short documentary about the work of data journalist and artist Mona Chalabi: [Journalism Through Art](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whose-truth-is-it-anyway/2019/11/truth-numbers-redefining-data-journalism-art-191114091038371.html). Her hand drawn style is really interesting as it can challenge dominant narratives and styles of representing data. And the style itself shows how there is always some uncertainty in the data:

> She believes that drawing can make data more accessible to people - and more transparent.
> "Part of the purpose of creating hand-drawn illustrations is that I want people to look at it and question the illustration that they see in front of them because the truth is that there is a high degree of imprecision in data," she says.
> "I think there's something to be said for an understanding that for every statistic that you see the truth lies somewhere in the parametres around that number."
