The [Tropes vs Women in Video Games](https://feministfrequency.com/series/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/) project is a fantastic series of video about "_sexist patterns associated with female representations in games, and to illuminate how these patterns reinforce and perpetuate harmful attitudes about women in our culture_". I watched [part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZPSrwedvsg) (embedded below) on "Women as Background Decoration" in games. And [part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i_RPr9DwMA), which centers more representation of male violence against women in video games.
