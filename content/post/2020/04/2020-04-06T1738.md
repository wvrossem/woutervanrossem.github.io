I am currently watching the second part of the documentary series "In Europa". This series focuses on news stories that did not gain so much attention, but could perhaps be seen as a sign of what was to come. With this in mind I find these news articles about China expelling American journalists as an example of such a news story of history in the making.

This move seems to signify a striking change in international relations. Read the full articles:

- The Guardian, ["Increasingly powerful, Xi's China believes it no longer needs Washington â€“ or its foreign reporters"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200406153823/https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/increasingly-powerful-xis-china-believes-it-no-longer-needs-washington-or-its-foreign-reporters).
