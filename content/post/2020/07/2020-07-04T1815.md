Two new video's I liked from Vox. Of course in their trademark style, but I gained interesting insights on some of the current events in the US:

* [Why America's police look like soldiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOAOVbyfjA0)
* [Why the US has so many Filipino nurses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8a8n7ZAZg)
