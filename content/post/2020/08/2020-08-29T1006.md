Due to the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a vast increase in conspiracy theories being spread. Tanya Basu at MIT Technology Review wrote an article titled [How to talk to conspiracy theorists—and still be kind](https://archive.vn/GogPT). The tips are based on insights from experts and r/ChangeMyView subreddit moderators.

1. Always, always speak respectfully.
2. Go private.
3. Test the waters first.
4. Agree.
5. Try the "truth sandwich."
6. Or use the Socratic method.
7. Be very careful with loved ones.
8. Realize that some people don’t want to change, no matter the facts.
9. If it gets bad, stop.
10. Every little bit helps.
