Three new videos from Vox give a good synopisis of some of the events playing in the world right now:

* [Facebook showed this ad to 95% women. Is that a problem?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wVPyiyukQc)
* [The British Museum is full of stolen artifacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoTxiRWrvp8)
* [The next pandemic could come from factory farms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwuujiHvduc)

Each video is about a very different, yet at the same time these three phenomena are linked by common themes. Which lives matter? Who decides? And who decides who decides?
