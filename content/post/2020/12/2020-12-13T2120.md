Today, after making home-made kimchi, my partner and I decided to listen to this podcast on Sinica about the history of the chile pepper in China. [In the episode](https://web.archive.org/web/20201213202416/https://supchina.com/podcast/chilies-and-china-brian-dott-on-how-a-new-world-import-defined-regional-cuisines-in-china/) Kaiser Kuo talks with historian Brian R. Dott about his latest book "The Chili Pepper in China: A Cultural Biography." A summary from [the book's web page](https://web.archive.org/web/20201213202548/http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-chile-pepper-in-china/9780231195324):

> Brian R. Dott explores how the nonnative chile went from obscurity to ubiquity in China, influencing not just cuisine but also medicine, language, and cultural identity. He details how its versatility became essential to a variety of regional cuisines and swayed both elite and popular medical and healing practices. Dott tracks the cultural meaning of the chile across a wide swath of literary texts and artworks, revealing how the spread of chiles fundamentally altered the meaning of the term spicy. He emphasizes the intersection between food and gender, tracing the chile as a symbol for both male virility and female passion. Integrating food studies, the history of medicine, and Chinese cultural history, The Chile Pepper in China sheds new light on the piquant cultural impact of a potent plant and raises broader questions regarding notions of authenticity in cuisine.
