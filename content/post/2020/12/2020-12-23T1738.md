[This Bloomberg article](https://web.archive.org/web/20201221150754/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads) deals with an interesting controversy surrounding the introduction of a feature called "App Tracking Transparency," which aims to give users the option to opt-out of tracking in apps. The article reports on newspaper full-page ads which Facebook published in response. Furthermore, [Mozilla has joined the debate](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216211511/https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/apples-anti-tracking-plans-iphone/) by publicly applauding Apple for the feature.
