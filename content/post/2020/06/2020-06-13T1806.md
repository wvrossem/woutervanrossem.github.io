Ian Bogost and Alexis C. Madrigal wrote a fantastic [piece at The Atlantic](https://web.archive.org/web/20200610174557/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win/606403/), "How Facebook Works for Trump". In this article they explain how the systems developed by Facebook to optimise advertising campaigns based on machine learning and with little human interaction are effectively exploited by the Trump campaign. They are very right in their conclusion that in this way Facebook systems are taking over some of the work of the campaign.
