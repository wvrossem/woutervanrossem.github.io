The following articles from The Register report on a current push for changes in some of the terms and metaphors used in software development. I definitely see the change as an improvement, to replace terms such as "blacklist" and "master-slave" to more inclusive use of language. See also the Internet Engineering Task Force draft on ["Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200615194034/https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1.1).
