As a long time ago player of the online role-playing game World of Warcraft I found this video about "[5 Ways Classic WoW Has Changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4HuKXgpw6E)" quite interesting. The game is quite old but has been recently re-released. The maker of this video goes into some of aspects on how even though it is mostly the same game, it is played in a drastically different form. The main difference I understand that there is a lot more knowledge sharing of how the game should be "played optimally". Which has been made possible through the rise of for example live streaming, Youtube, etc.

> With Classic WoW been out for a few months now, the game is played in a very different way than how it was played in the past! In this video I go over some of the ways gameplay has changed over the years!
