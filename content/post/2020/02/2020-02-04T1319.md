The ["Institute of Human Obscolescence"](http://speculative.capital/) is creating thought provoking speculative fiction artwork about changes in labour from advances in artificial intelligence and possible "human obscolescence". 

One project is called "biological labour" and envisages how bodies may produce elecricity for mining cryptocurrency:

> A single human body at rest radiates 100 watts of excess heat. We created a body-suit that uses thermoelectric generators to harvest the temperature differential between the human body and ambient and converts it into usable electricity. The electricity generated is then fed to a computer that produces cryptocurrency.
