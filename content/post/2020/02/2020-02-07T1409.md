AT Spui25 in Amsterdam for [the book launch](https://web.archive.org/web/20200210132038/https://www.spui25.nl/spui25-en/events/events/2020/02/secrecy-and-methods-in-security-research.html) of "Secrecy and Methods in Security Research". The pannelists gave presentations about their chapters in the book and discussed how they deal with secrecy in research. One common idea that the authors in this book tackle is to see secrecy not as an obstancle, but as a way to understand an organisation. In this way secrecy becomes productive or a research object of itself.
