Fisnished watching a documentary from DW Documentary, "The Big Bang that created todayâ€™s world". The two part documentary gives an overview of important events in 1989 that still shape our world today. See the video [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyz1cy6VeqA) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW7hqgVbMqM) on Youtube.

> 1979 was a year that still shapes our world even today. That was when three fundamental forces - the collapse of communism, neoliberalism, and politicized and radicalized religion, fused into a single potent force.
