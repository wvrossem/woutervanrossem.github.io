From a [No Tech Magazine post](https://web.archive.org/web/20200210145403/https://www.notechmagazine.com/2020/02/programmers-against-internet-voting.html), a quote from Bruce Schneier on a halted FOSS project for e-voting:

> “I’ve spent much of my limited time and energy trying to persuade people (and the UK government in particular) that a Free Software voting system is the only realistic way a trustworthy voting system could be created. But they are culturally set in their ways and always need to deal with companies, no matter how fragile their security actually is. Governments don’t even have the skills to assess the reliability of the people let alone the technologies these companies sell.”
