Two interesting articles from Wired dealing with current sociotechnical controversies:

* One article deals with the recent popular upscaled videos of historical footage and reactions from historians: ["YouTubers are upscaling the past to 4K. Historians want them to stop"](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018084709/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/history-colourisation-controversy)
* This article explains how Bluetooth is used for contact tracing apps and what some problems of the technology are: ["Bluetooth bugs are making contact tracing apps spit out tons of errors"](https://web.archive.org/web/20201019143006/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/contact-tracing-app-notification-bluetooth)
