Zoey Poll writes at Eye On Design how ["For Decades, Cartographers Have Been Hiding Covert Illustrations Inside of Switzerland’s Official Maps"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312000741/https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/for-decades-cartographers-have-been-hiding-covert-illustrations-inside-of-switzerlands-official-maps/). She argues that these hidden drawings are a kind resistance of Swiss cartographers and their mission to draw as accurate as possible:

> These barely-perceptible apparitions aren’t mistakes, but rather illustrations hidden by the official cartographers at Swisstopo in defiance of their mandate “to reconstitute reality.” Maps published by Swisstopo undergo a rigorous proofreading process, so to find an illicit drawing means that the cartographer has outsmarted his colleagues.
