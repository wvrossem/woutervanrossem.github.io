Watch the following great short film "The Neighbors' Window", which won an Oscar award. The film is based on a real story that was told on [Love + Radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20200303044346/http://loveandradio.org/2015/03/the-living-room/) podcast. I listened to that story a long time ago, so watching the film gave me a strange déjà-vu experience.
