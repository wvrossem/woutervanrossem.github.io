DW Documentary made available the fantastic documentary "Soyalism". I can recommend it if you are interested in the otherwise hidden and dark side of industrial food production. See the full documentary [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200328105911/https://www.dw.com/en/soyalism-the-world-food-business/av-52435603). Or [watch it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksrc7eI3IMY).

> Industrial agriculture is increasingly dominating the world market. Itâ€™s forcing small farmers to quit and taking over vast swathes of land. This documentary shows how destructive the lucrative agribusiness is.
