From the A Cypherpunk's Manifesto ([Eric Hughes, 1993](https://web.archive.org/web/20200326072621/https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)):

> "Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. ... We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy ... We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. ... Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and ... we're going to write it."
