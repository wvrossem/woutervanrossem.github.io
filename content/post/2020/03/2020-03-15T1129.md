Listened to two great podcasts from the BCC series "In Our Time" related to political economic theory from the late 18th century:

- One [podcast episode about "The Wealth of Nations"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b052ln55), the famous and still influential work of Adam.
- And [another episode on Malthusianism](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011zzh6), the demographic theory from Reverend Thomas Malthus.

Both episodes are interesting to understand the historical context and moral elements in their theories. Crudely summarised I would say that both of their theories are dealing with the abrupt transformation of   economies during the Industrial Revolution. And both authors bringing their moral philosophy of what should be done in that tumultuous time.
