[An article from Kottke.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200906081910/https://kottke.org/20/08/its-very-hard-to-tear-down-a-bridge-once-its-up) contrasts two examples infrastructural politics: the famous case of Robert Moses's bridge to limit who can access a New York beach, and the recent controversies on the Trump administration trying to dismantle the US postal servervice ahead of the November elections:

> The situation here is reversed — e.g. “it’s very hard to rebuild a bridge once it’s torn down” — but the lesson is the same. If you take mailboxes off the streets and junk sorting machines, it’s difficult to put them back, particularly when everyone’s baseline shifts over the next few months and the decreased capacity and delays are normalized (and then exploited for political advantage). Destroying the United States Post Office would be far easier and cheaper than rebuilding it.
