[Theirtube](http://www.their.tube) is brilliant project from designer and developer [Tomo Kihara](https://www.tomokihara.com/) where you can discover how Youtube filter bubbles look for different people:

> Theirtube is a Youtube filter bubble simulator that provides a look into how videos are recommended on other people's YouTube. Users can experience how the YouTube home page would look for six different personas. Each persona simulates the viewing environment of real Youtube users who experienced being inside a recommendation bubble through recreating a Youtube account with a similar viewing history. TheirTube shows how YouTube’s recommendations can drastically shape someone’s experience on the platform and, as a result, shape their worldview.
