The Verge published an article that _delves into_ 😼 how we are [starting to “sound like ChatGPT”](https://web.archive.org/web/20250723161818/https://www.theverge.com/openai/686748/chatgpt-linguistic-impact-common-word-usage). Our relationship with language is evolving because of LLMs, impacting our thinking in ways we may not yet comprehend.

> We’re approaching a splitting point, where AI’s impacts on how we speak and write move between the poles of standardization, like templating professional emails or formal presentations, and authentic expression in personal and emotional spaces. Between those poles, there are three core tensions at play. Early backlash signals, like academics avoiding “delve” and people actively trying not to sound like AI, suggests we may self-regulate against homogenization. AI systems themselves will likely become more expressive and personalized over time, potentially reducing the current AI voice problem. And the deepest risk of all, as Naaman pointed to, is not linguistic uniformity but losing conscious control over our own thinking and expression.
