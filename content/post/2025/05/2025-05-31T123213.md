[According to Nikkei Asia](https://archive.is/20250329071759/https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Movie-durations-rise-with-streaming-but-clash-with-consumer-trend), the trend of longer movies is at odds with the rise of faster playback speeds on streaming platforms, reflecting viewers’ desire to watch videos more efficiently. Streaming removes traditional movie constraints like physical media limitations (e.g., 120 mins VHS tapes), giving creators more freedom. This, however, may not align with what consumers are looking for.

Also, I recommend the [Tech Won’t Save Us podcast episode featuring Will Tavlin](https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/258_what_netflix_has_done_to_movies_w_will_tavlin), who talks about how Netflix’s platform affects their movie-making process.
