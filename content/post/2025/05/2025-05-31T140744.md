I came across some articles examining how automation is impacting South Korea’s mass food catering, specifically school lunches and highway restaurants. I really enjoy eating healthy and inexpensive meals at places like these. But this also means that they are facing significant challenges because of labour shortages and rising costs.

[A Rest of the World investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20250525084922/https://restofworld.org/2025/robot-chefs-south-korea-restaurants/) explores automation in highway restaurants. A key takeaway from this article is that automation is influencing not only food preparation but also the menu, with a shift towards dishes easily prepared by machines. Workers’ duties also evolve to include robot monitoring, restocking, and similar responsibilities.

A different perspective on robots in school cafeterias i[s provided by The Korea Herald](https://web.archive.org/web/20250524110108/https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10494256), focusing less on criticism and more on the companies that make them. My takeaway from both articles is that these technologies offer help with repetitive work, heavy lifting, and dangerous tasks, thus protecting humans from risks such as cuts and burns. However, I hope the food keeps some unique human touches and varied recipes, instead of becoming standardized everywhere.
