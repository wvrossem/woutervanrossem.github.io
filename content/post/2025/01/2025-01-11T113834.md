Nadia Plesner’s captivating [“Colony Collapse Disorder” (2020)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240713111446/http://www.nadiaplesner.com/paintings) series features oil paintings on beehive frames, incorporating imagery of vintage canned food. I see [the artwork](https://web.archive.org/web/20250111024330/http://www.nadiaplesner.com/upl/website/paintings/Webcolony3_srcset-large.jpg) as representing the precarious relationship between food systems struggling under climate change (in this case, the role of pollinators) and the emergency connotations of canned goods.
