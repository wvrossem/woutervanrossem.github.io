To combat dropping user engagement on older social media platforms, it appears Meta/Facebook plans to add AI-generated users that will post AI-generated content. Below is a quote from [an article in the Financial Times](https://web.archive.org/web/20241230131645/https://www.ft.com/content/91183cbb-50f9-464a-9d2e-96063825bfcf):

> “We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,” said Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that’s where we see all of this going,” he added.

A social network for interacting with bots, called SocialAI, [already exists](https://web.archive.org/web/20241215154616/https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247253/social-ai-app-replace-humans-with-bots). However, on a platform where both function concurrently, differentiating between them will likely become increasingly difficult. In the end, [a stale, lifeless feeling already pervades the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory). Drowning in information overload, perhaps only bots will survive, quietly processing through the digital debris.
