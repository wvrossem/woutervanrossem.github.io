I’m disgusted by the White House’s official account [posting an ASMR video on deportations](https://archive.is/20250218185901/https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1891922058415603980).

To better understand, let’s revisit sociologist Zygmunt Bauman’s perspective on the Holocaust. His argument was that the Holocaust’s origins were in modernity itself, not only in the unique histories of Germany and the Jewish people. 

Similarly, we should examine how contemporary techniques are being used. This case shows how social media’s tools are used to dehumanize and [morally neutralize](https://web.archive.org/web/20241207025606/https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/modernity-and-the-mechanisms-of-moral-neutralisation/) through ASMR, memes, and irony.
