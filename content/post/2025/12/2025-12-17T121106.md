An [Atlas Obscura piece](https://web.archive.org/web/20251217031407/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/67-meme-childrens-lore-iona-peter-opie), drawing on Iona and Peter Opie’s work on children’s folklore, explores the meaning of the seemingly meaningless “67”:

> “And through these quaint ready-made formulas the ridiculousness of life is underlined, the absurdity of the adult world and their teachers proclaimed, danger and death mocked, and the curiosity of language itself is savoured.”

> The ridiculousness and pointlessness of “67” is perhaps why it has succeeded so extravagantly as a meme, breaking out of the classroom to become Word of the Year: it perfectly encapsulates everything the Opies understood that kids need out of their private jokes.

Ian Bogost, meanwhile, [offers a useful counterpoint](https://web.archive.org/web/20251216210505/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/six-seven-meme-over/685231/) on how fragile such memes become once exposed to adult attention and monetization

> [W]hat started in their network soon became a social currency for adults online. Gen Xers and Millennials—the parents of today’s middle schoolers—couldn’t leave six-seven be; they’re accustomed to burning through such memes like their parents or grandparents did cigarettes, as if culture writ large can withstand habitual abuse. Social-media-influencer culture also latched on to the phrase for its own attentional ends, as did brands, the indefatigable scavengers. These forces stole six-seven from the kids who had nurtured it.
