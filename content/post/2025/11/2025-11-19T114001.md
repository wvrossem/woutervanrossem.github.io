I’ve been curious about the now-ubiquitous use of black disposable gloves in food-focused social media, and also increasingly in traditional marketing and the street-level marketing of restaurants. Their rise is undeniably aesthetic, but there also seem to be some practical reasons behind the trend.

On camera, black gloves create a clean, uniform look that seem to signal professionalism or a desire to appear contemporary, viral, and “relevant.” Bare hands, by contrast, maybe carry an implied sense of poor hygiene—even though that isn’t necessarily true. If you look at Reddit or YouTube comments, you’ll find plenty of people who worry that black gloves might actually encourage less frequent handwashing, or who feel they signal food that will be overpriced or part of a short-lived fad. (I have to admit, I tend to agree.)

With a bit more research, though, it turns out the appeal isn’t only about aesthetics. Unlike traditional white latex gloves, these black gloves are typically made of nitrile—a material that offers better durability, puncture resistance, and protection against oils and chemicals. Nitrile gloves also tend to come in colors such as black, blue, and green, so the black look does have a practical basis.
