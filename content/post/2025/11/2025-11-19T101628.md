Living in Seoul, one quickly encounters ongoing debates about urban redevelopment in a city where public and private interests, heritage conservation, and the need for green spaces constantly intersect. Below are two recent articles from *The Korea Herald* that explore such themes:

* [Redevelopment near Jongmyo Shrine](http://archive.today/2025.11.19-013837/https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10615790): a controversial project adjacent to the UNESCO World Heritage site that highlights the tension between preserving historic areas and revitalizing aging parts of the city.

* [Demolition of the former Millennium Hilton Seoul](http://archive.today/2025.11.19-013813/https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10614564): a look at the demolition of a significant example of modern Korean architecture, along with exhibitions that reflect on the legacy of Korean modernism and efforts to preserve traces of it.

On a related note—but this time in the context of Brussels—I recently read [an interview with Leo Van Broeck](http://web.archive.org/web/20251119014313/https://www.bruzz.be/actua/stedenbouw/leo-van-broeck-over-de-bouwstop-brussel-er-voor-elke-oplossing-een-probleem-2025) on the Brussels news site *Bruzz*. He mentions how strict heritage protections in the city can limit redevelopment opportunities, including the creation of green spaces that are essential for addressing the effects of climate change.
