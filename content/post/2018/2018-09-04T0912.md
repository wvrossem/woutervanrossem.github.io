[This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828100756/https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2018/06/28/women-on-waves-three-youtube-suspensions-this-year-show-yet-again-that-we-cant-let-internet-companies-police-our-speech/) caught my attention since I saw the nice documentary on their work as well, and seems they now struggle with Youtube suspending their account: "*Women on Waves’ three YouTube suspensions this year show yet again that we can’t let internet companies police our speech*".
