Look at these beautiful photos of the human impact on the planet (cfr. anthropocene) in [this article from the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2018/oct/18/the-human-signature-edward-burtynskys-anthropocene-in-pictures): "*Burtynsky’s unsettling large-scale images of industrial-scale extraction, urbanisation and deforestation reveal humanity’s devastating impact on the planet*".
