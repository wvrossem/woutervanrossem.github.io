From [@ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/blog/australia-anti-encryption-law/) on a new Autralian anti-encryption law: "*There is nothing new about a government seeking to break encryption. From the British Investigatory Powers law to the NSA’s possible decryption programs, law enforcement agencies around the world are working hard to gain an edge over information security technology. But Australia’s new law goes much further, deputizing tech businesses as accomplices in a surveillance scheme so loosely conceived that no one really knows its limits.*" .
