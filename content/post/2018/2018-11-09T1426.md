[An article on refugee abuse](https://www.dw.com/en/refugee-abuse-trial-opens-in-germany/a-46204799) made me think of Judith Butler on the Abu Ghraib prison questioning what it "*means to become ethically responsive, to consider and attend to the suffering of others, and, more generally, of which frames permit for the representability of the human and which do not*".
