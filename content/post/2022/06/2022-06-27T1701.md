Clive Thompson makes some interesting remarks about the story of the Google engineer Blake who became convinced that Google’s conversation technology LaMDA. [In a blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20220624060055/https://clivethompson.medium.com/one-weird-trick-to-make-humans-think-an-ai-is-sentient-f77fb661e127) he references the work of Sherry Turkle who showed how humans perceive robots as more real when robots seem needy:

> This is something I’ve learned from the work of Sherry Turkle, the famous MIT scientist who studies the relationship between humans and machines. Turkle has studied a ton of robot-human interactions, and talked to a lot of users (and designers) of robots that are designed for human companionship— i.e. toy-robot babies, or toy-robot animals.

> One thing she noticed? The more that a robot seems needy, the more real it seems to us.
