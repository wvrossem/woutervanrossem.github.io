The current move towards vaccination certificate mandates risks excluding certain people. As Alyna C Smith, Deputy Director at PICUM, [explains](http://web.archive.org/web/20220115080525/https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/4/covid-19-certificate-schemes-may-exclude-undocumented-people) this approach for increasing vaccination rates risks having other side-effects.

> [T]hey also create a genuine risk of deepening mistrust and exclusion for undocumented people, while failing to address the underlying reasons for disparate vaccine uptake. Just as worrying, the heightened policing that inevitably comes with the widening use of certificates is likely to push undocumented people further into the margins.
