The [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqicS22qVJ0) is a short excerpt from a PBS documentary about the history of blue jeans.

> Where did blue jeans begin? This iconic American garment can be traced to fabrics woven in India, France and Italy and a knowledge of indigo dying from Africa and brought to the colonies in the trade of enslaved people. Blue jeans’ roots are as deep and entangled as the nation’s.
