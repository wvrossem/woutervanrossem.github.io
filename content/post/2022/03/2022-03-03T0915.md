From [a short article](http://web.archive.org/web/20220303082423/https://aboutintel.eu/privacy-and-automated-osint/) by Jan-Jaap Oerlemans on the privacy risks of automated open source intelligence:

> [T]raditional OSINT has evolved into a professional and intrusive practice. With the use of tools hundreds of online sources can be queried simultaneously. These sources are diverse and can range from publicly available data on social media services, to location data generated by advertisements on apps on mobile phones, to leaked user data. Automated OSINT interferes with the right to privacy and the right to the protection of personal data more seriously than before.
