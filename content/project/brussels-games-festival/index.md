I spent a few years, between 2013 and 2016, as a member of Ludiris, a non-profit association committed to organising a board games festival in Brussels. I was responsible for developing the event website and engaging with the Dutch and English board gaming communities. We observed a significant rise in attendance over three years, going from about two thousand to roughly ten thousand. In order to cope with this significant growth, I designed a website using Middleman, a static site generator tool. It met our multilingual needs and offered a fast and efficient website.
